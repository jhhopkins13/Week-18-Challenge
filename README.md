# Social Network API

This API provides a backend solution for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to their friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. It's built using MongoDB, a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. This project uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
